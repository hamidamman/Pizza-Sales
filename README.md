🍕 Pizza Sales Dashboard Journey 🚀



Hey LinkedIn fam! 🌟 Excited to share the journey of creating an end-to-end interactive Power BI dashboard for our Pizza Sales Report. 📊 Let's slice through the key stages and insights:



1. Data Extraction 🧹

Using Power Query, we streamlined our data extraction, transforming messy pizza data into a deliciously organized dataset. 🍅🧀



2. Data Cleaning 🚿

Addressing null values, fixing errors, and bidding farewell to duplicates, our data got a thorough clean-up. A pizza without unwanted toppings is like data without unnecessary columns! 🍕



3. Data Refinement 🔍

DAX magic came into play! Calculated columns and measures turned raw data into actionable insights. 📈 Average order value and pizzas per order got their DAX makeover. 🎩✨



4. Data Modeling 🗂️

Our data needed a solid foundation. We crafted relationships, built star and snowflake schemas, ensuring our pizza insights were structured and easy to digest. 🍽️



5. Data Visualization 📊

The real fun began! From daily and monthly trends to pie charts (pun intended) showcasing sales by category and size – we created a visual feast. 🍕📈
